## INTRODUCTION
### DEFINING THE PROBLEM

The growing patient data databases improve predictive models which allows developers to find diseases earlier when creating personalized treatments. Medical researchers deploy the Random Forest Classifier to evaluate historic healthcare data in order to identify diseases based on statistical probability. 
The goal involves employing machine learning methods to enhance diagnosis precision to let healthcare personnel execute early interventions and change treatment protocols.

### CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND

Healthcare predictive analytics requires different statistical and machine learning models for analyzing structured along with unstructured data. Doctors often achieve poor results when using logistic regression due to its inability to understand complex nonlinear patterns in medical data.
Robotics systems play a crucial role in healthcare because the Random Forest Classifier shows strong capabilities when dealing with large medical datasets that have value imbalances.

The healthcare prediction field benefits from using decision trees as well as support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks according to previous research findings. 
Multiple trees combined through Random Forest outperform single decision trees since they work together to achieve more stable and accurate classifications according to Breiman (2001). The Random Forest algorithm will serve as the prediction model for assessing patient disease risk based on their medical data.

### OBJECTIVES AND GOALS

For this project, we must be nearing to the goals we have set those are given as follows

- The implementation of Random Forest Classifier for disease prediction requires patient data processing.
- Compare model performance against baseline classifiers such as logistic regression.
- The model needs evaluation through accuracy measurement combined with precision rates and recall scores and AUC-ROC calculations.
- The analysis of feature importance allows us to determine which factors serve as the main predictors for disease diagnosis.
- Build functionality into the model which deals effectively with healthcare sector datasets that have an unbalanced distribution.
- Achieve better performance metrics with an improved computational speed.
- Create an easy-to-use system that enables healthcare staff to use machine learning analytic results in their work.
- Compare model performance against baseline classifiers such as logistic regression.
- The accuracy precision recall and AUC-ROC metrics will be used in a performance analysis of the model.
- Use feature importance to comprehend the major disease prediction factors.

### SUMMARY OF APPROACH

#### Random forest classifier
The Random Forest model implementation in scikit-learn needs parameter adjustment enabled by the library to reach maximal performance levels.

#### Selecion and training 
The evaluation of the model effectiveness depends on cross-validation analysis together with key performance indicators including accuracy as well as precision and recall and AUC-ROC.

#### Analysis
Embedding vital patient features related to prediction accuracy helps healthcare professionals better understand the analysis results.

#### Data acquisition and preprocessing 
The first operational step requires dataset loading for subsequent healthcare data cleaning procedures which integrate feature engineering tasks.

#### Model training
Scikit-learn operates through the system to conduct Random Forest model training procedures.


## METHODOLOGY

### DATA ACQUISITION AND SOURCES

The "Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile Dataset" originates from Kaggle and features structured information about demographic data as well as symptoms together with diagnosed diseases. The dataset originated from healthcare records which have undergone anonymization and combined with symptom assessment reports. The preprocessing operations start with dealing with missing data elements followed by encoding categorial attributes and performing scale normalization on numerical features to enhance both consistency and model prediction accuracy.

An ensemble learning method called Random Forest Classifier consists of multiple decision trees in its structure. The model performs prediction on outcome  by collecting decision tree predictions from multiple trees that use features .

$$
\
\hat{y} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} h_t(x)
\
$$

The ensemble consists of trees denoted by  within a total of  trees. The split criterion depends on Gini Impurity which defines as:

$$
Gini = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2
$$

The formula for calculating Gini impurity includes the proportion of class  in a node represented by Pi and C the total number of classes.

### ANALYTICAL PROCEDRUES 

A sequential guide explains how the Random Forest model should be trained along with its evaluation process:

1. The program retrieves the dataset by reading the CSV file.
2. The data needs preprocessing to handle missing values, conduct categorical variable encoding and normalize all numerical features.
3. The dataset requires division into training segments comprising 80% of the data while the remaining 20% constitutes the testing portion.
4. **RandomForestClassification** The model gets implemented through `scikit-learn` tools while completing hyperparameter optimization for better results.
    - Important predictors can be determined through the application of `feature_importances_`.
    - we have to plot sensitivity versus specificity through Receiver Operating Characteristic curve plotting.
    - We need to create data visualisation through the classifier in `seaborn`
5. Evaluation metrics
- Accuracy : the proportions of correct predictions

$$ 
Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}
$$

   - Precision : The ration of true to total predictions

$$
Precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}
$$

   - Recall : The ability of model to identify the predictions

$$
Recall = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}
$$
 
TP : True Positives

TN : True Negatives 

FP : False Positives

FN : False Negatives
