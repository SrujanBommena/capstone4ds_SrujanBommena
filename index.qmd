# LITERATURE REVIEW

## Quantifying and Explaining Machine Learning Uncertainty in Predictive Process Monitoring

### BACKGROUND / MOTIVATION :

#### CONTEXT

The entire framework of speculative process monitoring lies at the
juncture between artificial intelligence (AI) and operations research
(OR) under complicated industrial environments. Businesses are heavily
reliant on their decision-making processes driven by data, so they want
to compete well. Since predictive models typically overlook the various
uncertainties that characterize real-world processes, their relevance in
circumstances that might rapidly evolve appears to be limited. This
research aims to tackle critical issues in predictive analytics,
particularly in production planning, by fusing explainability and
uncertainty quantification (UQ) into machine learning (ML) workflows.

#### PROBLEM OR GAP IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE

-   The neglect of data-driven estimation of technical production
    parameters, with many studies relying on assumptions or intuition.

-   The dominance of deterministic predictive models that do not
    consider uncertainty, limiting their reliability in real-world
    scenarios.

-   The lack of methods to explain sources of uncertainty in
    predictions, which hinders their practical application and
    acceptance by stakeholders.

#### SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH QUESTION

The research aims to integrate uncertainty quantification and
explainability into predictive analytics for production planning,
addressing the limitations of traditional models. This enhances the
reliability, transparency, and utility of predictive analytics, enabling
more informed and effective decision-making in dynamic manufacturing
environments.

### METHODS USED

#### METHODS AND USES

The overview of the whole process used in the analytics is summarized as
a picture below;

1 Quantile regression forests (QRF) is a more general method of random
forests that gives prediction intervals. QRF provides prediction
intervals for uncertainty quantification.

$$ \[
w_i(x, \theta) =
\frac{1\{X_i \in R_\ell(x, \theta)\}}
{\sum_{j : X_j \in R_\ell(x, \theta)} 1}
\] $$

$$ \[
w_i(x) = k_1 \sum w_i(x, \theta_t)
\] $$

2 SHAP provides explanations of the contribution of individual input
features to predictively uncertain clearness. It also enhances
explainability by identifying key predictor features.

$$
g(z_0) = 0 + \sum_{i} \alpha_i z_0^i
$$

EXACT SHAP VALUES :

$$ \[
x_0 (z_0) = \frac{M - 1}{\binom{M}{|z_0|}\cdot |z_0| \cdot (M - |z_0|)} $$

3 Process-aware information systems (PAIS) leverage manufacturing
execution systems data to build comprehensive event logs for predictive
modeling in general. PAIS grounding the model in real-world data
captures production process complexity and variability.

#### TECHNIQUES AND APPROACHES

Using SHAP to explain prediction intervals instead of point predictions
lends greater insight into the sources of uncertainty. Your response
will normally go into further detail about the fact that the uncertainty
may be profiled as low, medium, and high, though this will enable
targeted interventions and make better decisions on managing risk. The
implementation of probabilistic estimations and explainability
techniques on real-world production planning scenarios tightens the
relationship between theory and practice.

### SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WORK

#### KEY FINDINGS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

1.  In QRF predictive intervals, higher reliability has been obtained,
    attaining 90 Percent PuC for test datasets.
2.  SHAP analysis indicates that production quantity, material
    properties, and historical processing times had a direct impact on
    prediction intervals.
3.  Uncertainty quantification gives added benefits for decision-making
    in areas with very high uncertainty.
4.  The confluence of uncertainty quantification and explainable
    artificial intelligence brings about models that profile accuracy
    and interpretability.

#### IMPLICATIONS AND BROADER CONTEXT

The approach can be integrated with optimization approaches to improve
decision-making in the face of uncertainty, making it extremely useful
for prescriptive analytics. To ensure that decisions are resilient to
variability, the QRF model's outputs, for example, can be immediately
integrated into optimization frameworks for scheduling, resource
allocation, or inventory management. The significance of explainability
in fostering confidence in machine learning systems is further
highlighted by this study. It enables users to verify model predictions
and pinpoint possible areas for development by offering insights into
the factors that contribute to uncertainty. This is especially crucial
in high-stakes industries like manufacturing, where choices made using
inaccurate or ambiguous models may have serious operational or financial
repercussions. extending the paradigm to further fields where
uncertainty is crucial, like healthcare or supply chain logistics.

### WORK CONNECTIONS

#### PAPAER RELEVANCE

Predict-then-optimize and Explainable AI are two approaches adopted in
Operations Research (OR) to amplify decision-making.
Predict-then-optimize uses predictive analytics to forecast an event
and/or behavior of a system to determine the most viable course of
action with the use of optimization models. Explainable AI aims to
transform complex OR models into more clear and comprehensible
formulations that build trust and identify biases. Research in these
areas utilizes such techniques as sensitivity analysis, local
explanations, and counterfactual reasoning. Fundamental research on
Random forests and SHAP aims to understand their strengths and
limitations, properly identify potential biases, and work toward
increased interpretability and explainability.

#### DIFFER FROM PREVIOUS WORKS

Predictive analytics has demonstrated its utility in estimating
parameters within optimization models. However, the studies mainly
presume an expected outcome and are thus less useful in the highly
unpredictable context. To allow for the quantification of variability
during the consequent optimization phase, uncertainty quantification is
included into the prediction stage in this study.

HOW IT IS DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS WORKS : The study offers a fresh
glimmer that has been spun around raw footages through publication after
publication with a grain of prediction taken up on the foundation of
deterministic outcomes.The development work, very clearly, offers a
complete framework which raises the level of prescriptive analytics just
to add predictive process monitoring into it, and integrates findings
from several perspectives.

### MY PROJECT RELEVANCE

This capstone project on Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics for
outcome prediction via historical data should be considered a very
promising way of quantifying and explaining uncertainty in predictions
using Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) and the SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) method. Whenever and wherever predictions based on
event-based data are carried out, improved predictive accuracy functions
to employ advanced preprocessing and feature engineering techniques. The
methods themselves can feature multiple applications, particularly in
health, retail, and financial forecasting. Continuous model updates help
improve predictive accuracy and adaptability. The paper emphasizes the
importance of combining predictive with prescriptive analytics in the
decision-making process, which in turn gives practical recommendations
to stakeholders.
